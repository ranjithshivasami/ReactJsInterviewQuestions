<summary><strong>What is a Virtual DOM and Diff between realDom and VirtualDom</strong></summary>
<p>

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in a web page

The process of updating in React
1. The ReactDOM.render() renders the elements on the screen on the first load by creating the real and virtual DOM trees.

2. Any change to an element (such as a key press or button click) leads to a notification sent to the virtual nodes for a state change. If any property of the node is altered, it updates itself.

3. React compares the updated virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates the real DOM accordingly. This process is known as reconciliation. This is done using a heuristic algorithm known as the Diffing Algorithm.

4. The updated real DOM is rendered on the screen.

<summary><strong>What is fragment
?</strong></summary>
<p>

In React, a Fragment is a way to group multiple children elements without adding an extra DOM element to the output. It's a lightweight wrapper that doesn't create an additional DOM node in the rendered HTML, which can be useful in situations where you need to return adjacent JSX elements without enclosing them in a parent HTML element.

Here's how you can use a Fragment in React:

```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>React Fragments</p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

```
Alternatively, you can use the shorthand syntax for fragments introduced in React 16.2:

```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>React Fragments</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the deferent between statefull vs stateless component ?
</strong></summary>
<p>

The difference between stateful and stateless is that one has state, and the other doesnâ€™t. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.

Stateful component :

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // useState is a Hook that adds state to functional components
  // The initial state (count) is set to 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment the count
  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Update the count state
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;


```
Example of a stateless functional component:


```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</p>

<summary><strong>
What is Higher Order Component
</strong></summary>
<p>
A higher-order component in Reactjs is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props. It's a technique that allows you to reuse logic across multiple components.

A higher-order component can be adjusted to fit the needs of different components, also it can be reused to enhance multiple components with the same logic.

HOCs are particularly useful when you want to share logic between components that are similar but not identical. 
They are also commonly used for implementing features like authentication, error handling, and data loading.

<summary><strong>
How data flow in react ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, data flows in a unidirectional manner, which means it follows a specific path from parent to child components. 
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>
What is prop drilling ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
Prop drilling, also known as "prop passing" or "component chaining," is a situation in React where data is passed through multiple levels of nested components as props, even when intermediate components do not use that data themselves. This can occur when you need to send data from a high-level parent component to a deeply nested child component, and you have to pass it through multiple intermediary components in the component tree.

To mitigate the issues related to prop drilling, you can consider alternative solutions:

<strong>Context API:</strong> Use React's Context API to share data between components without the need for prop drilling. This is particularly useful for global state management.

<strong>Redux:</strong> Implement a state management library like Redux, which allows you to store and access application-wide state without prop drilling.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>
What are children props ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, the children prop is a special prop that allows you to pass components, elements, or content between the opening and closing tags of a custom component. It is often used to create reusable components that can encapsulate and render content or components provided by their parent components.

Here's how you can use the children prop:
```
function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent>
        <p>This is the content provided to ChildComponent.</p>
        <button>Click me</button>
      </ChildComponent>
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Child Component</h2>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}

```
In this example, ChildComponent is a reusable component that can wrap any content or components passed as its children. When you use it within ParentComponent, the content provided between the <ChildComponent> tags becomes the children prop of ChildComponent.

<summary><strong>
Why we used functional component ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
Functional components are used in React for several reasons, and their popularity has grown significantly since the introduction of React Hooks. Here are some key reasons why you might choose to use functional components:

<strong></strong>Simplicity and Conciseness:</strong> Functional components are essentially JavaScript functions, which makes them simpler and more concise compared to class components. They are easier to read and understand, especially for developers new to React.

<strong>Easier to Test: </strong>Functional components are pure functions that take props as input and return JSX as output. This purity makes them easier to test because you can predict their behavior based solely on their input, which simplifies unit testing.

<strong>Hooks for State and Side Effects:</strong> React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and other React features that were previously exclusive to class components. Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext provide powerful capabilities for functional components.

<strong>Reusability and Composition:</strong> Functional components can be easily composed together. They are ideal for creating small, reusable components that can be combined to build complex UIs. This encourages a more modular and maintainable code structure.

<strong>Performance:</strong> Functional components can be optimized for performance using techniques like memoization and the React.memo higher-order component. React's performance optimizations apply equally to both functional and class components.

<strong>Function as Child Components (Render Props):</strong> Functional components are well-suited for implementing the "function as child" or "render props" pattern, where a component receives a function as a prop, allowing customization of behavior.

<strong>Simplified Lifecycle Management:</strong> Functional components can use the useEffect hook to manage side effects and mimic the behavior of class component lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

<strong>Easier Migration:</strong> If you're starting a new project or migrating from class components to functional components, using functional components with hooks can provide a smoother transition and allow you to leverage the latest React features.

<strong>Consistency with JavaScript:</strong> Functional components align more closely with JavaScript's functional programming paradigm, making them more natural for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.

<summary><strong>
What is useEffet and when to use?
</strong></summary>
<p>
The useEffect hook is a fundamental part of React's hooks system, and it's used for managing side effects in functional components. Side effects in React typically include actions such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscribing to external data sources.

Here's a basic overview of the useEffect hook and when to use it:
<strong>Syntax:</strong>

```
import { useEffect } from 'react';

useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run after rendering or when dependencies change
}, [dependencies]);

```

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

* The first argument to useEffect is a function that contains the code you want to run as a side effect.
* The second argument is an optional array of dependencies. If provided, the effect will only run when one or more of these dependencies change. If omitted, the effect will run after every render.
<strong>When to Use useEffect:</strong>

1. Data Fetching: You can use useEffect to fetch data from APIs, databases, or other external sources. You typically run the effect after the initial render and whenever relevant dependencies (e.g., query parameters) change.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch data and update component state
}, [dependencies]);

```

2. DOM Manipulation: When you need to interact with the DOM (e.g., adding or removing elements, changing styles), you can use useEffect to perform these actions after the component has rendered.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // DOM manipulation code here
}, [dependencies]);

```
3. Subscriptions and Event Listeners: If you need to set up event listeners or subscribe to external data sources (e.g., WebSocket connections), useEffect is a suitable place to do this. Make sure to clean up these subscriptions in the effect's cleanup function.

```
useEffect(() => {
  // Set up event listeners or subscriptions
  return () => {
    // Clean up event listeners or subscriptions
  };
}, [dependencies]);

```
4. Performing Cleanup: When you need to perform cleanup operations when the component unmounts or before a new effect runs, you can return a cleanup function from the useEffect.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run after rendering or when dependencies change

  return () => {
    // Cleanup code (e.g., clear timers, close connections)
  };
}, [dependencies]);

```
5. Changing Component State: You can use useEffect to modify the component's state based on certain conditions or when dependencies change. However, be cautious to avoid infinite loops by ensuring that state updates don't trigger the same effect again.
```
useEffect(() => {
  if (someCondition) {
    // Update component state
  }
}, [dependencies]);

```
6. Conditional Effects: You can use useEffect conditionally by placing conditions inside the effect function. This allows you to run different code based on certain conditions.
```
useEffect(() => {
  if (someCondition) {
    // Run one set of code
  } else {
    // Run another set of code
  }
}, [dependencies]);

```

In summary, useEffect is a versatile hook that allows you to manage various side effects in functional components. You should use it when you need to perform actions that go beyond rendering components, whether it's fetching data, interacting with the DOM, subscribing to data sources, or performing cleanup operations. The second argument, the array of dependencies, helps control when the effect should run, optimizing the performance of your component.

<summary><strong>
What is useRefs?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, the useRef hook is used to create and interact with a mutable ref object. A ref is a way to access and interact with the properties of a DOM element or a React component instance directly. Unlike state, changes to refs do not trigger re-renders of the component, making them suitable for managing mutable values and accessing DOM elements imperatively.

Here are some common use cases for useRef:

1. Accessing DOM Elements: You can use useRef to access and manipulate DOM elements directly. This is often necessary when you need to work with third-party libraries that require direct access to DOM elements or when you need to focus an input element programmatically.
2. Preserving Values Between Renders: Unlike state variables, ref values don't cause re-renders when they change. This makes refs suitable for preserving values between renders without affecting the component's render cycle.
3. Storing Previous Values: You can use useRef to store and access previous values of props or state, which can be useful in certain scenarios, such as comparing the previous and current values to determine if an action should be taken.
4. Imperative DOM Manipulation: In some cases, you may need to imperatively modify DOM elements, for example, to trigger animations, scroll to a specific position, or perform other imperative actions. useRef can be used to access and manipulate DOM elements directly.

<summary><strong>
What is lazy loading ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
Lazy loading, also known as deferred loading, is a technique used in web development to optimize the loading of assets (typically, images, scripts, or other resources) on a webpage. The main idea behind lazy loading is to delay the loading of non-essential or off-screen content until it's needed, thereby improving page load times, reducing bandwidth usage, and providing a better user experience.

</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>
How to implement Lazy loading in ReactRoute using ReactRouterDom?
</strong></summary>
<p>

Lazy loading in React Router using React Router DOM involves dynamically importing components and rendering them only when the route is matched. This can significantly improve the initial loading time of your application by loading only the necessary components for the current route. To implement lazy loading in React Router, you can use dynamic imports and the React.lazy function.
<srtong>Create Routes with Lazy Loading:</srtong>
In your application, define your routes using React.lazy to dynamically import components. Each route should use the lazy function and Suspense for fallback rendering while the component is loading.

```
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

// Import components using dynamic import (lazy loading)
const Home = lazy(() => import('./components/Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./components/About'));
const Contact = lazy(() => import('./components/Contact'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
          <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;

```

In this example, we use dynamic imports to load the Home, About, and Contact components lazily. The Suspense component provides a fallback while the imported components are loading.
<strong>Build Your Application:</strong>
Depending on your build tool (Webpack, Create React App, etc.), you may need to configure it to support dynamic imports and code splitting. Create React App, for instance, supports dynamic imports out of the box.

Why using className instead of class in react ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, you should use the className attribute instead of the class attribute when specifying CSS classes for HTML elements. This is because React follows the JavaScript naming convention for attributes and properties, and class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
</p></details>

<summary><strong>
How to handle error in react what is the error boundary in react ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, you can handle errors using Error Boundaries, which are special components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application. Error Boundaries are a way to gracefully handle errors that might occur during rendering, in event handlers, or in componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.

How to call API in react js?
</strong></summary>
<p>
To call an API in a React.js application, you can use various methods and libraries. Here's a basic example of how to make an API request using the fetch function, a built-in JavaScript method. Additionally, I'll provide an example using the axios library, which is a popular choice for handling API requests in React.

<summary><strong>
What is the limitation of react?
</strong></summary>
<p>

React is a powerful and popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but like any technology, it has its limitations. It's important to be aware of these limitations when deciding whether React is the right choice for your project. Here are some of the limitations of React:

<strong></strong>Learning Curve:</strong> React introduces concepts like components, props, state, JSX, and a virtual DOM. For developers new to React or JavaScript, there can be a steep learning curve. However, once you understand these concepts, it becomes more straightforward.

<strong>Boilerplate Code:</strong> React can require a fair amount of boilerplate code, especially for setting up components, managing state, and handling side effects. While tools like Create React App help, larger applications may still require additional configuration and setup.

<strong>Complex State Management:</strong> While React provides the useState hook and useReducer for managing component-level state, more complex state management across multiple components can become challenging. Libraries like Redux or Mobx are often used for such scenarios.

<strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> React's virtual DOM helps optimize rendering, but inefficient component updates can still impact performance. Developers need to be mindful of how they structure their components and avoid unnecessary renders.

<strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</strong> While React supports server-side rendering, setting up and configuring SSR can be complex and may require additional libraries and tools.

<strong>Not Opinionated About Data Fetching:</strong> React doesn't provide a built-in solution for data fetching. Developers need to choose libraries or methods for making API requests and managing data flow (e.g., Axios, fetch, GraphQL, Redux, Apollo Client).

<strong>SEO Challenges:</strong> While SSR can improve SEO, single-page applications (SPAs) built with React may require additional SEO optimizations to ensure search engines can properly index the content.

<strong>Lack of Built-in Routing:</strong> React itself doesn't include a built-in routing solution. Developers often use third-party libraries like React Router for handling client-side routing.

<strong>Large Bundle Sizes:</strong> Depending on how it's configured and used, React applications can have large bundle sizes, which can impact initial page load times. Code splitting and lazy loading can help mitigate this issue.

<strong>Ecosystem Fragmentation:</strong> React's ecosystem is extensive, which can lead to fragmentation. Developers must choose from various state management solutions, routing libraries, and other tools, which can lead to decision fatigue.

<strong>Mobile Development:</strong> While React Native allows for mobile app development using React, it's a separate technology with its own learning curve and limitations. It may not cover all use cases for mobile development.

<strong>Community and Maintenance:</strong> The fast pace of development in the JavaScript ecosystem means that libraries and tools can become outdated quickly. Staying up to date with React and its ecosystem can be challenging.

Despite these limitations, React is widely used and has a vibrant community that actively addresses many of these challenges through open-source libraries and best practices. Many of the limitations can be mitigated or addressed with careful design, appropriate libraries, and experience. Ultimately, whether React is suitable for a particular project depends on the project's requirements and the team's familiarity with the technology.

<summary><strong>
What is pure component in react?
</strong></summary>
<p>
React pure components are the components that do not re-render when the value of props and state has been updated with the same values. Since these components do not cause re-rendering when the same values are passed thus they improve performance.
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>
 What is the difference between state and props?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, both state and props are mechanisms for managing data and communication within a component-based application, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences:

<strong>Props (Properties):</strong>

</strong>Immutable:</strong> Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the component that receives them. They are passed from a parent component to a child component.

</strong>External Data:</strong> Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow a parent component to communicate with its child components by providing data and configuration.

</strong>Top-Down Data Flow:</strong> Data in props flows in a unidirectional (top-down) manner. Changes in props at the parent level can trigger re-renders in child components that receive those props.

</strong>Pure Functions:</strong> Components that rely solely on props, without using internal state, are often referred to as "pure" or "stateless" components. They are predictable and easier to test.

</strong>Initialization:</strong> Props are typically initialized in the parent component and passed down to child components. Child components cannot modify their props directly.

</strong>State:</strong>

</strong>Mutable:</strong> State is mutable and can be modified using the setState method within the component that owns the state. Class components have state, while functional components can use the useState hook to manage local state.

</strong>Local Data:</strong> State is used for managing data that is specific to a component and doesn't need to be shared with other components. It represents the internal state of a component.

</strong>Component-Specific:</strong> Each component instance has its own state. Changes to a component's state trigger re-renders of that component only, not its parent or child components.

</strong>Lifecycle Methods (Class Components):</strong> State management often involves lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount, which allow you to perform side effects and update state.

</strong>Initialization:</strong> State is typically initialized in the component's constructor or using the useState hook in functional components. It is managed and updated within the component.

In summary, props are used for passing data and configuration from parent to child components and are immutable, while state is used for managing local, mutable data within a component and is specific to that component. Understanding the distinction between props and state is crucial for building React applications effectively, as it helps you manage data flow and maintain the separation of concerns between components.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>
What are the different lifecycle methods?
</strong></summary>
<p>

1. componentWillMount (deprecated) - this is most commonly used for App configuration in your root component.

2. componentDidMount - here you want to do all the setup you couldnâ€™t do without a DOM, and start getting all the data you need. Also if you want to set up eventListeners etc. this lifecycle hook is a good place to do that.

3. componentWillReceiveProps (deprecated) - this lifecyclye acts on particular prop changes to trigger state transitions.

4. shouldComponentUpdate - if youâ€™re worried about wasted rendersâ€ŠshouldComponentUpdate is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop. shouldComponentUpdate should always return a booleanâ€Šand based on what this is will determine if the component is rerendered or not.

5. componentWillUpdate (deprecated) - rarely used. It can be used instead of componentWillReceiveProps on a component that also has shouldComponentUpdate (but no access to previous props).

6. componentDidUpdate - also commonly used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
7. componentWillUnmount - enables you can cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

<summary><strong>
Explain React Hooks.
</strong></summary>
<p>
Hooks let you use more of Reactâ€™s features without having to use classes. The first hook that you will most likely encounter is useState. useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. It returns an array with a getter and a setter.

The syntax looks like
```
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>;
```

The equivalent when using a class component would be.
```
this.state = {
  count: 0,
};

<button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
  Increase Count
</button>;

```

The next hook you will most likely encounter is useEffect. The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. By passing an empty array as the second argument to useEffect is equivalent to using componentDidMount. If you pass a value to the array it will only call the useEffect function when the value in the array updates.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // do stuff when the component mounts
}, []);
```

<summary><strong>
What are controlled components?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, controlled components are a pattern used to manage and synchronize form elements, such as input fields and textarea elements, with component state. The key characteristic of a controlled component is that its value is controlled by React's state, and any changes to the input value are handled through React's event system.
</p>

<summary><strong>
When rendering a list what is a key and what is it's purpose?
</strong></summary>
<p>
When rendering a list of elements in React, the "key" is a special attribute that you should assign to each item in the list. The primary purpose of keys is to help React identify and keep track of individual elements in the list efficiently. Keys serve several important functions:

1. <strong>Element Identification:</strong> Keys provide a unique identifier for each element within the list. React uses these keys to distinguish between elements and determine which items have been added, removed, or reordered when the list is updated.

2. <strong>Efficient Updates:</strong> When the list is re-rendered due to changes in data or state, React uses keys to optimize updates. It aims to update the DOM in the most efficient way possible by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and DOM manipulations.

3. <strong>Preservation of Component State:</strong> Keys help React preserve the state of components associated with list items. Without keys, React may re-render components even if their position in the list changes, potentially leading to lost component state.

4. <strong>Stable Referencing:</strong> Using keys ensures that React maintains a stable reference to each element, even if the list is reordered or elements are added or removed. This is important for certain features like animations and maintaining scroll position.

<summary><strong>
What is redux?
</strong></summary>
<p>
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library commonly used in React applications for managing the application's state in a predictable and centralized manner. It is particularly popular for handling complex state management needs in large-scale or data-intensive web applications. Redux provides a single source of truth for the application's data and helps maintain a clear separation between state management and the UI components.

Key concepts and components of Redux include:

<strong>Store:</strong> The central data store in Redux that holds the application's entire state. It is a plain JavaScript object that represents the global state of the application.

<strong>Actions:</strong> Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe events or changes in the application. They have a type property that defines the action type and optional payload data to carry additional information.

<strong>Reducers:</strong> Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state based on that action. Reducers must be pure, meaning they produce the same output for the same input, and they should not have side effects.

<strong>Dispatch:</strong> The dispatch function is used to dispatch (send) actions to the Redux store. It triggers the execution of reducers, resulting in updates to the state.

<strong>Selectors: </strong>Selectors are functions used to extract specific pieces of data from the state. They help in efficiently accessing and computing derived data from the state.

<strong>Middleware:</strong> Middleware functions provide a way to extend Redux's behavior. They can intercept and process actions before they reach the reducers, enabling features such as logging, asynchronous actions, and routing.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>
What is Redux Thunk used for?
</strong></summary>
<p>

Redux Thunk is a middleware for the Redux library that enables asynchronous actions to be dispatched in a Redux application. It allows you to write action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects. These functions can perform asynchronous operations, such as making API requests, and then dispatch plain action objects when the asynchronous work is complete. Redux Thunk is commonly used to handle side effects and asynchronous logic in Redux applications.

What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, both useMemo and useCallback are hooks used for optimizing performance by memoizing values and functions, respectively. However, they serve slightly different purposes and are applied to different scenarios:

1. useMemo:

  * useMemo is primarily used for memoizing (caching) the result of a computation or value based on some dependencies. It ensures that the computed value is only recalculated when the dependencies change.
  * It's commonly used when you want to avoid recomputing the same value in every render cycle, especially when the computation is expensive.

2. useCallback:

  * useCallback is used for memoizing functions, particularly event handlers or functions that are passed as props to child components. It's particularly useful when dealing with functional components and performance optimization.
  * It returns a memoized version of the function that only changes when one of its dependencies changes.

In summary:

* Use useMemo when you want to memoize the result of a computation.
* Use useCallback when you want to memoize a function, typically for passing it as a prop to child components or when defining event handlers.

<summary><strong>
What are the advantages of react-router?
</strong></summary>
<p>
React Router is a popular library for handling client-side routing in React applications. It provides several advantages that make it a valuable choice for managing routing within a React application:

* <strong>Declarative Routing:</strong> React Router uses a declarative approach to define the routes of your application. You define your routes using components and JSX, making it easy to understand and manage the routing structure.

* <strong>Nested Routing:</strong> React Router allows you to nest routes within components, which makes it straightforward to create complex layouts with multiple levels of nested views.

* <stromng>Dynamic Routing:</strong> You can use route parameters to create dynamic routes. This is essential for building applications that display different content based on URL parameters or route segments.

* <strong>Browser-Like Navigation:</strong> React Router provides a browser-like navigation experience with support for history management, including features like back and forward navigation, and the ability to programmatically navigate to different routes.

* <strong>Route Matching and Navigation:</strong> It offers powerful route matching capabilities, allowing you to specify exact matches, partial matches, and route parameters. Navigation between routes can be done using the <Link> component, useHistory hook, or programmatically with history.push().

* <strong>Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:</strong> React Router supports code splitting and lazy loading of route components. This allows you to load only the JavaScript code needed for the current route, improving the application's initial load time.

* <strong>Route Guards and Redirects:</strong> You can implement route guards and redirects to control access to specific routes or to handle authentication and authorization logic.

* <strong>Query Parameters:</strong> React Router supports query parameters in URLs, making it easy to pass data between routes or to implement search and filtering functionality.

* <strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): </strong>React Router is compatible with server-side rendering and static site generation, enabling SEO-friendly and performant server-rendered React applications.

* <strong>Community and Documentation:</strong> React Router has a large and active community, along with comprehensive documentation and a wealth of tutorials and resources available online.

* <strong>Pluggable:</strong> React Router is designed with extensibility in mind. You can customize its behavior and add additional functionality by using plugins and custom route components.

How react defered from other js librarieas nad frame works?
</strong></summary>
<p>
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it has several distinctive features and philosophies that set it apart from other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Here are some key ways in which React differs from other libraries and frameworks:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** React's core concept is a component-based architecture. It encourages developers to break down user interfaces into small, reusable components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

2. **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Virtual DOM) to efficiently update the actual DOM. When data changes, React calculates the minimum number of DOM updates needed, minimizing performance bottlenecks.

3. **Unidirectional Data Flow:** React enforces a unidirectional data flow, which means that data flows in one directionâ€”from parent components to child components. This simplifies data management and makes it easier to understand how changes propagate through the application.

4. **JSX:** React introduces JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX helps define the structure of components and makes it more intuitive to work with user interfaces in code.

5. **Reactivity:** React promotes a reactive programming model, where components automatically re-render when their state or props change. This declarative approach simplifies UI updates and reduces the need for manual DOM manipulation.

6. **No Opinions on Data Fetching:** React itself doesn't provide a built-in solution for data fetching or state management. Instead, it can be combined with libraries and tools like Redux, Mobx, Axios, or GraphQL to manage data flow and state.

7. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** React has strong support for server-side rendering (SSR), allowing you to render components on the server and send pre-rendered HTML to the client. This can improve initial page load times and SEO.

8. **Large Ecosystem:** React has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that extend its functionality, including routing libraries (React Router), state management solutions (Redux, Mobx), and UI component libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design).

9. **React Native:** React has a sibling project called React Native, which enables you to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android using React and JavaScript. This allows for code sharing between web and mobile apps.

10. **Strong Community:** React has a large and active community of developers, resulting in extensive documentation, a wide range of tutorials, and a wealth of open-source contributions.

11. **Learning Curve:** While React is relatively easy to get started with, its concepts, such as components, props, and state, may require some initial learning. However, once mastered, React provides a powerful and flexible toolset.

12. **Granularity:** React provides a high level of granularity, giving developers fine-grained control over the structure and behavior of their user interfaces. This can be beneficial for custom and complex UIs.

It's important to note that React is not a full-stack framework like Angular or a framework with a comprehensive ecosystem like Vue.js. Instead, React is often used in conjunction with other libraries and tools to build complete web and mobile applications. The choice of React versus other libraries or frameworks depends on the specific project requirements and developer preferences.

<summary><strong>
Why should we not update the state directly?
</strong></summary>
<p>
If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

```
//Wrong
this.state.message = "Hello world";
```

Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

```
//Correct
this.setState({ message: "Hello World" });
```

Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

What is the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript?
</strong></summary>
<p>
TypeScript and JavaScript compared

In terms of features, here are 10 significant differences between JavaScript and TypeScript:

* TypeScript can be strongly typed, while JavaScript is dynamically typed only.
* TypeScript is more readable and maintainable than JavaScript.
* TypeScript supports abstraction through interfaces, while JavaScript does not.
* TypeScript allows developers to annotate code with decorators, while JavaScript does not.
* TypeScript supports the ability to modularize and organize components through the use of namespaces, which is not supported in JavaScript.
* TypeScript is more expressive than JavaScript, through the use of syntax elements such as optional and named parameters.
* TypeScript supports generics and a type inference feature that is not available in JavaScript.
* TypeScript IDEs have more features, as it is easier to build plugins and tools for a statically typed language.
* TypeScript code is easier to debug as the codebase expands, because type errors can be discovered at compilation time rather than runtime.
* TypeScript implements additional features beyond the limited ECMAScript specification to which JavaScript complies.

TypeScript makes JavaScript better

TypeScript isn't a competitor to JavaScript. Instead, TypeScript complements JavaScript.

TypeScript provides the community with a more dynamic, full-featured and safer way to develop enterprise-grade applications where the target runtime requires JavaScript.

TypeScript isn't designed to replace JavaScript. Instead, its purpose is to encourage the proliferation of JavaScript-based platforms by making it easier to write, integrate, manage and maintain code.

JavaScript-driven platforms such as NodeJS on the server and ReactJS on client side continue to gain in popularity. The ability to write code in TypeScript and turn it into JavaScript is one of the reasons adoption rates for both languages continue to climb.

What are Semantic Tags in HTML ?
</strong></summary>
<p>
Semantic HTML tags are elements that carry meaning about the structure and content of a web page. They are used to describe the type of content contained within them, making the HTML code more meaningful and accessible. Semantic tags play a crucial role in improving the accessibility, SEO, and overall structure of a web page.

Here are some common semantic HTML tags:

1. `<header>`: Represents the introductory content or a container for a set of navigational links.

2. `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page intended for navigation links.

3. `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.

4. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post or news article.

5. `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content, such as chapters, or tabs in a tabbed interface.

6. `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, like sidebars or pull quotes.

7. `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a document or a section, often containing copyright information or contact details.

8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: `<figure>` represents self-contained content, such as an image, while `<figcaption>` provides a caption for that content.

Using semantic tags not only makes your HTML code more structured and meaningful but also helps search engines understand your content better. Additionally, it can improve accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.

what are controled and uncontroled conponent in react
</strong></summary>
<p>
In React, controlled and uncontrolled components refer to how you manage and handle form elements (such as input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons) and their values within your React application.

1. **Controlled Components:**
   - In a controlled component, React maintains the component's state, and the component's value is controlled by React itself.
   - You explicitly set the component's value in the component's state, and React updates the UI to reflect the state.
   - When the user interacts with the component (e.g., types in an input field), an event handler is used to update the state, and the component re-renders with the new value.
   - Controlled components are typically used when you want to have more control over the form elements, such as validating input, preventing certain actions, or synchronizing multiple form elements.

   Example of a controlled input element:
   ```jsx
   class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { value: '' };
     }

     handleChange(event) {
       this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
     }

     render() {
       return (
         <input
           type="text"
           value={this.state.value}
           onChange={e => this.handleChange(e)}
         />
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Uncontrolled Components:**
   - In an uncontrolled component, React does not manage the component's state, and the component's value is directly controlled by the DOM.
   - You typically use refs to directly access the DOM element and its value.
   - Uncontrolled components are useful when you want to integrate React with non-React code or libraries, or when you want to avoid the overhead of managing component state for every form field.

   Example of an uncontrolled input element:
   ```jsx
   class UncontrolledInput extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.inputRef = React.createRef();
     }

     handleSubmit() {
       alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.inputRef.current.value);
     }

     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           <input type="text" ref={this.inputRef} />
           <button onClick={() => this.handleSubmit()}>Submit</button>
         </div>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

In summary, the key difference is that controlled components have their values controlled by React's state, while uncontrolled components have their values controlled by the DOM itself. The choice between controlled and uncontrolled components depends on your specific use case and requirements. Controlled components are generally recommended for most React applications because they provide a more predictable and easier-to-test way of managing form elements and their values.

<summary><strong>
explain react hooks
</strong></summary>
<p>
React Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to manage state and side effects, previously only achievable with class components. Hooks enable developers to reuse stateful logic across different components without changing their component hierarchy. They also make it easier to read, write, and test stateful logic within functional components.

Here are some of the most commonly used React Hooks:

1. **useState:**
   - `useState` allows functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```

2. **useEffect:**
   - `useEffect` is used for side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
     }, [count]);
     ```

3. **useContext:**
   - `useContext` allows components to access values from the nearest `Context` provider in the component tree.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const user = useContext(UserContext);
     ```

4. **useReducer:**
   - `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic. It is often used when the state transitions depend on the previous state.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
     ```

5. **useRef:**
   - `useRef` creates a mutable ref object that can hold a reference to a DOM element or any mutable value. It is often used for accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const myRef = useRef();
     ```

6. **Custom Hooks:**
   - Developers can create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic. Custom hooks should start with the word "use" by convention.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
       // Custom hook logic
     }
     ```

React Hooks provide several advantages:

- **Improved Code Reusability:** Hooks allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across components, reducing code duplication.
- **Simplified Component Logic:** Functional components using Hooks are often more concise and easier to read than equivalent class components.
- **Better Testability:** Isolating and testing logic within custom hooks is straightforward, enhancing the testability of your application.

While React Hooks offer many benefits, it's important to note that they don't replace class components entirely. Class components are still valid and necessary in some cases, particularly when working with legacy codebases or integrating with certain third-party libraries. However, functional components with Hooks have become the preferred choice for most new React applications due to their simplicity and flexibility.

</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>How do you define and use props in a React component with TypeScript?</strong></summary>
<p>
In TypeScript, you define and use props by creating an interface for the expected props and specifying it in the component's definition. Props are then accessed using the `props` property.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What is the difference between React's state and props, and how are they typed in TypeScript?</strong></summary>
<p>
Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, and they are read-only. State is used to manage data that can change within a component and is mutable. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces to define the types for both props and state.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Explain the concept of generics in TypeScript and how they can be used with React components.</strong></summary>
<p>
Generics allow you to create reusable components and functions that work with different data types. In React, you can use generics to create components that are more flexible and type-safe, such as generic components that can work with different data structures.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What are hooks in React, and how are they used in TypeScript?</strong></summary>

<p>
React context allows you to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props. In TypeScript, you can define context types and use them to ensure type safety when accessing context values.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>How can you integrate third-party libraries or components written in JavaScript into a TypeScript-based React application?</strong></summary>
<p>
You can integrate JavaScript libraries by using TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) to provide type definitions for the library. These declaration files help TypeScript understand the library's API and ensure type safety when using it in your code.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the `@types` packages in TypeScript, and how do they relate to React development?</strong></summary>
<p>
The `@types` packages provide type definitions for JavaScript libraries and APIs. When using TypeScript with React, you can install relevant `@types` packages to obtain type definitions for libraries, allowing for better type checking and auto-completion in your code.

<p>
You can create HOCs with TypeScript by specifying generic types for the input and output props. This allows you to create flexible and type-safe HOCs that can be applied to various components.
</p>
</details>

## CSS Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the CSS Box Model, and how does it work?</strong></summary>
<p>
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. Each layer affects the size and spacing of an element.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Explain the difference between `display: inline` and `display: inline-block` in CSS.</strong></summary>
<p>
The `display: inline` property makes an element behave like an inline element, allowing other elements to appear next to it on the same line. `display: inline-block` makes an element behave like an inline element while allowing block-level properties to be applied, such as setting a width and height.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What are CSS Pseudo-classes and how are they used?</strong></summary>
<p>
CSS Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element. Examples include `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, and `:nth-child`. They are often used for styling elements in response to user interactions.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Explain the concept of specificity in CSS. How is specificity calculated?</strong></summary>
<p>
Specificity in CSS determines which style rules take precedence when there is a conflict. Specificity is calculated using a four-part value (a,b,c,d) where:
- a represents inline styles.
- b represents IDs.
- c represents classes, pseudo-classes, and attribute selectors.
- d represents elements and pseudo-elements.
The style with the highest specificity wins in case of a conflict.

</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What is the CSS `float` property, and how does it work?</strong></summary>
<p>
The `float` property is used to make an element float to the left or right within its container. It is often used for creating layouts with text flowing around the floated element. However, it has limitations and potential issues, and flexbox or grid layout is now preferred for layout purposes.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What is the CSS `position` property, and what are the values it can take?</strong></summary>
<p>
The `position` property is used to control the positioning of an element. It can take values like `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`. Each value has different behavior, such as `relative` positioning relative to its normal position, `absolute` positioning relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, and so on.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Explain the concept of CSS Flexbox and when it is used for layout.</strong></summary>
<p>
CSS Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to design complex layouts with a more efficient and predictable way to distribute space and align content. It is especially useful for creating one-dimensional layouts, such as rows or columns, and aligning items within those layouts.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>What is CSS Grid Layout, and how does it differ from Flexbox?</strong></summary>
<p>
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout model for creating grid-based layouts. It allows you to define both rows and columns and their sizes independently. While Flexbox is well-suited for one-dimensional layouts, Grid Layout is more powerful for creating complex two-dimensional layouts.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>How do you implement responsive web design using CSS media queries?</strong></summary>
<p>
Responsive web design is achieved by using CSS media queries to adapt the layout and styling of a web page based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width. Media queries enable you to create designs that look and function well on various screen sizes and devices.
</p>
</details>
<details>
